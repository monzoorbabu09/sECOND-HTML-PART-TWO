        <h3>Our Performance</h3>The JSC and SSC examinations are conducted by the Board of Secondary and Intermediate Education under the Ministry of Education. Junior School Certificate (JSC) is a public examination taken by students in Bangladesh after successful completion of eight years of schooling[6] and Secondary School Certificate (SSC) is the diploma awarded for the completion of grade ten, which is equivalent to the O Levels in the UK. The JSC examination consists of nine subjects totalling 900 marks, with each subject given 100 marks and the SSC examination consists of eleven subjects totalling 1,100 marks, with each subject given 100 marks, including practical tests for science subjects. A minimum of 33 marks are required to pass each subject. Subjects will depend on which major program a student has elected to study. These major programs are Sciences; Arts and Humanities; and Business Studies. Students have to elect one of these three programs just before enrolment in the 9th grade for SSC. Results of both the exams are published in the form of a GPA. The highest score is GPA-5

    <blockquote><q>you ever been at sea in a dense fog, when it seemed as if a tangible white darkness shut you in and the great ship, tense and anxious, groped her way toward the shore with plummet and sounding-line, and you waited with beating heart for something to happen? I was like that ship before my education began, only I was without compass or sounding line, and no way of knowing how near the harbor was. “Light! Give me light!” was the wordless cry of my soul, and the light of love shone on me in that very hour</q> .</blockquote>
